Handing them my trust, when they have routinely proven that they are not trustworthy, would render-pointless every hardship and effort towards safety and security which I've been required to endure since those events so many years ago. \n\nBy prioritizing my personal safety in both of these cases, the end result is that I am no longer able to engage and connect with people from my work life via the two most common business-centric social networks. The alternative is no alternative at all; **choosing not to be safe is not a choice**. \n\nI know what it's like to have my choice taken from me, and I never want that to happen again. \n\n\n",

				"title": "Memories of Harmonic Distortion, Descending Carson Pass",
				"content_html": "<p>While training for The Death Ride one year, so many years ago, I had quite a surprise on Highway 88 while descending Carson Pass in the Sierra Nevada. This was in the late season, the last week of October, a last minute plan with a best friend to get one last ride in before the snow storms arrived. On top of the usual physical challenges of climbing ~2,500' vertical up to 8,575 elevation, it was uncommonly cold.</p>\n<p>For the background, I loved endurance racing, and the many long, standing (not seated) hill climbs and mountain passes always were my favorite. Climbing the front-side and then heading down the back-sides of big mountain passes in the Sierra Nevada at 50+mph (80kph) was however not my favorite - but a good lesson in reaping what you sow. Thankfully I never crashed on those, despite having climbed all of the majors and several lesser traveled, many times over: Monitor, Ebbetts, Carson, Echo, Rose, Yuba, Donner, Tioga, Brockway, Daggett, Luther, Pacific Grade Summit, and famously adjacent Geiger Grade going to Virginia City (a common morning ride before work). All of my crashes were on mountain and cyclo-cross, so I was certainly not immune.</p>\n<p>The closest I came to a high speed get-off was on Carson Pass (highway 88), back in 2001. I was riding a new set of criterium race wheels that were ultra-lightweight, perfect for climbing up the pass to the summit, but during the descent speed-wobbles had set-in around the 45mph point and continued through to 54mph, starting directly after the first major right-hand curve.</p>\n<p>While arc&rsquo;ing the bike inside the turn, standard approach to manage centrifugal force, and then leaning it back upright as the road straightened, harmonic distortion set in, rippling faster and faster through the bike&rsquo;s frame, up into my body, blurring my vision. Sometimes going faster will sort out the wave, but not this time, and by 50mph the flexing nearly tore the wheels apart from a combination of light-weight hubs and spokes/rims not having sufficient torsional strength to sustain the pressure involved with the induced coefficient-of-friction and centrifugal force.</p>\n<p>This was the kind of turn with speed, which one can see racers engage with on the Tour, which require a rear-side body-torque movement to snap/push the frame out of its desire to continue through the curve and resume going straight - too much downward force started to turn the wheel into an slight oval. This same body movement is used in MotoGP and motocross racing, as it&rsquo;s an essential skill for powering through a curve while pushing physical limits. The feeling was like that of an al-dente noodle, if one were to imagine being thrown down a hill while trying to keep everything straight and rigid - just stiff enough to not immediately die, but very close to dying really quickly. Wearing a helmet in that case wouldn&rsquo;t have saved my life, as the pass is surrounded by granite walls and boulders and steep drops.</p>\n<p>It took an entire mile of deceleration, achieved through pulsing the front and rear brakes at a 30/70% ratio (like anti-lock brakes on a car, but without the computer), to safely slow down enough for the distortion to resolve. If you don&rsquo;t pulse the brakes then the pads can overheat and melt, contributing far worse conditions into the mix. By the ~30mph point I had recovered enough control over the bike to gently guide us to a turnout several miles down the pass and then dismount. A lot of adrenaline that day, the intensity of focus and attention to the senses required was certainly a high-point at my youngish age (early 20s).</p>\n<p>My friend, a far better racer than I&rsquo;d ever become, could only laugh at the scene. It wasn&rsquo;t either of our first experiences with harmonic distortion, and what else is there to do but laugh and get back on the bike? Away we went, continuing down the steep but fast and straight-smooth road to Woodfords where we parked the car.</p>\n<p>Well anyway, I had those wheels relaced with bladed titanium spokes and hardened steel nipples tensioned with a digital torque meter (not &ldquo;feeling the torque by hand&rdquo;), and never used them for hill climbs ever again.</p>\n<p>As for The Death Ride, they no longer include Highway 88&rsquo;s Carson Pass on the route, mostly due to safety.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beautiful photos and a grade map: <a href=\"https://www.tourofcalifornia.org/2006/07/death-ride.html\">www.tourofcalifornia.org/2006/07/d&hellip;</a></li>\n<li>Stats on the pass: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Pass\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars&hellip;</a></li>\n<li>The perfect yearly event: <a href=\"https://deathride.com\">deathride.com</a></li>\n<li>Mentions about Carson no longer being used: <a href=\"https://deathride.com\">deathride.com</a>/faq/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>#cycling #memories #theDeathRide #training #endurance</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

Away we went, continuing down the steep but fast and straight-smooth road to Woodfords where we parked the car. \r\n\r\nWell anyway, I had those wheels relaced with bladed titanium spokes and hardened steel nipples tensioned with a digital torque meter (not \"feeling the torque by hand\"), and never used them for hill climbs ever again.\r\n\r\nAs for The Death Ride, they no longer include Highway 88's Carson Pass on the route, mostly due to safety. \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n- Beautiful photos and a grade map: [www.tourofcalifornia.org/2006/07/d...](https://www.tourofcalifornia.org/2006/07/death-ride.html)\r\n- Stats on the pass: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Pass)\r\n- The perfect yearly event: [deathride.com](https://deathride.com)\r\n- Mentions about Carson no longer being used: [deathride.com](https://deathride.com)/faq/\r\n\r\n#cycling #memories #theDeathRide #training #endurance\n\n<img src=\"https://prose.winterschon.com/uploads/2025/24-percent-grade.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://prose.winterschon.com/uploads/2025/scrn-cap.2025-0519-0700-20.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"463\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://prose.winterschon.com/uploads/2025/death-ride-profile.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\">\n",

We had to fight and push to get OSS into the corporate sphere for decades, and sure enough, people take that for granted.</p>\n<p>There used to be an alignment where OSS was to &ldquo;be against the corporate overloads of closed-source&rdquo;, about &ldquo;freedom of choice and implementation&rdquo;, about &ldquo;fair use licenses&rdquo;. This was in opposition to Microsoft, Oracle, ATT unix, SCO unix, etc. But we all know what happened. The big names bought their way in, pumped up all the money making schemes, and now we see this trite marketing where billion dollar companies get to role play like they care about the communities which WE built over the past three+ decades.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Go look at the recent Fedora website redesign. Look at Canonical. There are many examples and one can find them easily by perusing the Distro-Watch list of a 100+ remakes.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m in no way against corporate interest and benefit when it&rsquo;s ethical, when it&rsquo;s up-front and honest about its intentions. Though they are not my favorites of the world, at least Redhat and Oracle don&rsquo;t try to pull one over on the user with their main sites &ndash; it&rsquo;s obvious that they are there for corporate players and for profitability, which is fine. I&rsquo;ve paid for their licenses, for their hardware, many times in many ways, from personal use to license structures while operating a startup, so I&rsquo;m not anti-corporation in the overall sense.</p>\n<p>However, this approach to &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all in this together&rdquo; fake messaging is tiresome. The irony of Fedora being owned by Redhat, who is owned by IBM; draw whatever conclusions one wants there, but they are all managed by different sectors.</p>\n<p>So then, do we really need to be sold on the community aspect of what is inherently a community of developers working together for a shared goal? No, we do not, those are supposed to be intrisic and inherent qualities without need of mention.</p>\n<p>Who does it better?

Those lies fell apart in 1989 and we all hoped that would be the end of it... but of course not.\n\nThe Perception\n> Das Kollektiv der Gemeinschaft!\n> Wir sind f√ºr Sie da! \n> Schlie√üt euch den Reihen des Proletariats an und vernichtet den Menschen!\n\nTranslated, loosely\n> The collective of the community!\n> We are here for you!\n> Join the ranks of the proletariat and destroy the Man!\n\nI do not want your communism.\nI do not want your pseudo-cooperatives.\nI do not want your kollektiv of anything.\n\nWe've had our community this whole time, and the corporate influence was supposed to be secondary. We had to fight and push to get OSS into the corporate sphere for decades, and sure enough, people take that for granted.\n\nThere used to be an alignment where OSS was to \"be against the corporate overloads of closed-source\", about \"freedom of choice and implementation\", about \"fair use licenses\". This was in opposition to Microsoft, Oracle, ATT unix, SCO unix, etc. But we all know what happened. The big names bought their way in, pumped up all the money making schemes, and now we see this trite marketing where billion dollar companies get to role play like they care about the communities which WE built over the past three+ decades. \n\nDon't believe me? Go look at the recent Fedora website redesign. Look at Canonical. There are many examples and one can find them easily by perusing the Distro-Watch list of a 100+ remakes.\n\nI'm in no way against corporate interest and benefit when it's ethical, when it's up-front and honest about its intentions. Though they are not my favorites of the world, at least Redhat and Oracle don't try to pull one over on the user with their main sites -- it's obvious that they are there for corporate players and for profitability, which is fine. I've paid for their licenses, for their hardware, many times in many ways, from personal use to license structures while operating a startup, so I'm not anti-corporation in the overall sense.\n\nHowever, this approach to \"we're all in this together\" fake messaging is tiresome. The irony of Fedora being owned by Redhat, who is owned by IBM; draw whatever conclusions one wants there, but they are all managed by different sectors.\n\nSo then, do we really need to be sold on the community aspect of what is inherently a community of developers working together for a shared goal? No, we do not, those are supposed to be intrisic and inherent qualities without need of mention. \n\nWho does it better? Here's a non-exhaustive short list from the top of my mind. \n\n- Gentoo (https://www.gentoo.org)\n- Chimera (https://chimera-linux.org)\n- SUSE (https://www.suse.com)\n- Void (https://voidlinux.org)\n\nDon't get me going on the BSDs... they are perfect and I love them, so it's a totally different conversation. üíó \n",

				"title": "Performance \u0026 Regressions -- How Orgs Ship Code to Production",
				"content_html": "<p>See that image? Right around the mid-section we see a common problem with the manner in which code is shipped to production. That one little section, displayed as a subsection of &ldquo;build &amp; packaging&rdquo;, happily named &ldquo;regression + performance testing&rdquo;. Whether the product is a user-facing site, or middle-ware component, or baremetal systems which provide cloud resources that we all know and (sometimes) love&hellip; the success of the product is gated by an org&rsquo;s ability to prioritize testing and automations for &ldquo;Performance XOR Regression&rdquo; (some orgs consider them inclusive, some consider them separate).</p>\n<p>So we see Performance and Regressions visualized as practically a footnote, which is representative of the present landscape: many orgs don&rsquo;t understand regression at scale vs regression in labs vs regression modeling. Most concerning is that too many orgs fail to provide management directives which involve full Perf+Reg test coverage. Instead, as a result of the lack of understanding, many orgs expect that their engineering teams will miraculously &ldquo;make time&rdquo; in their fully allocated and often over-subscribed schedules. That is not possible, and when production suffers, we all suffer. (insert meme with person riding bike, then falling from their own mistakes, wincing in pain on the ground, painfully expressing &ldquo;Why would the code do this to us?&quot;)</p>\n<p>Secondly, a common misconception from engineering (eng teams and their management structure) is that Perf/Reg testing exists solely in that one stage. One simple misconception often causes an array of new and unnecessary tech debt, while often concurrently perpetuating existing tech debt.</p>\n<p>Ok. So who is not failing at Performance and Regression testing? We can look to the ground-breaking engineering efforts on projects which have defined the human race: Voyager I and II, the J.Webb Space Telescope, CERN&rsquo;s particle accelerators, and many others. What&rsquo;s the difference? Time and planning, adhering to standards, routine audits, change controls, and many more.</p>\n<p>How about simpler projects? Do they attend to P&amp;R as well as JBL or CERN or Los Alamos? Unfortunately not. Over the course of nearly a quarter century of focus on this and related topics, the strong majority of orgs which I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working at have engaged in &ldquo;Spectrum Testing&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Binary Testing&rdquo; when it comes to performance + regression analysis, expecting that half-measures will be sufficient. They are not, and because this area of engineering requires investment of time, people, and hardware, it often becomes a budgetary line item to cross out during the times in which it is most critical. Such is the reality of simple and sometimes willful ignorance. Humans are fallible, expectedly so, but the beautiful thing is that we can change and learn and improve; but how&hellip; through awareness, analysis, and iterative adjustment (just like in engineering).</p>\n<p>Investing partially, whether fiscally or in human hours, is not sufficient. Planning these elements for success always requires time, hardware, and people: investment and awareness. No one sends a telescope into Lagrange orbit one half-million miles from earth without proper test coverage (this isn&rsquo;t the Hubble (sorry, sorry, I know it&rsquo;s not funny)).

				"content_text": "See that image? Right around the mid-section we see a common problem with the manner in which code is shipped to production. That one little section, displayed as a subsection of \"build & packaging\", happily named \"regression + performance testing\". Whether the product is a user-facing site, or middle-ware component, or baremetal systems which provide cloud resources that we all know and (sometimes) love... the success of the product is gated by an org's ability to prioritize testing and automations for \"Performance XOR Regression\" (some orgs consider them inclusive, some consider them separate).\n\nSo we see Performance and Regressions visualized as practically a footnote, which is representative of the present landscape: many orgs don't understand regression at scale vs regression in labs vs regression modeling. Most concerning is that too many orgs fail to provide management directives which involve full Perf+Reg test coverage. Instead, as a result of the lack of understanding, many orgs expect that their engineering teams will miraculously \"make time\" in their fully allocated and often over-subscribed schedules. That is not possible, and when production suffers, we all suffer. (insert meme with person riding bike, then falling from their own mistakes, wincing in pain on the ground, painfully expressing \"Why would the code do this to us?\")\n\nSecondly, a common misconception from engineering (eng teams and their management structure) is that Perf/Reg testing exists solely in that one stage. One simple misconception often causes an array of new and unnecessary tech debt, while often concurrently perpetuating existing tech debt.\n\nOk. So who is not failing at Performance and Regression testing? We can look to the ground-breaking engineering efforts on projects which have defined the human race: Voyager I and II, the J.Webb Space Telescope, CERN's particle accelerators, and many others. What's the difference? Time and planning, adhering to standards, routine audits, change controls, and many more.\n\nHow about simpler projects? Do they attend to P&R as well as JBL or CERN or Los Alamos? Unfortunately not. Over the course of nearly a quarter century of focus on this and related topics, the strong majority of orgs which I've had the pleasure of working at have engaged in \"Spectrum Testing\" instead of \"Binary Testing\" when it comes to performance + regression analysis, expecting that half-measures will be sufficient. They are not, and because this area of engineering requires investment of time, people, and hardware, it often becomes a budgetary line item to cross out during the times in which it is most critical. Such is the reality of simple and sometimes willful ignorance. Humans are fallible, expectedly so, but the beautiful thing is that we can change and learn and improve; but how... through awareness, analysis, and iterative adjustment (just like in engineering).\n\nInvesting partially, whether fiscally or in human hours, is not sufficient. Planning these elements for success always requires time, hardware, and people: investment and awareness. No one sends a telescope into Lagrange orbit one half-million miles from earth without proper test coverage (this isn't the Hubble (sorry, sorry, I know it's not funny)). The reasons are obvious. However, back on terra, faulty and insufficiently tested code can deploy to a hyperscaler's cloud with sufficient impact that national and global infrastructure goes offline, and that code can ship without a second set of eyes? Yep. It happens, but it does not need to happen. We can expect better, and we should. Engineers and end-users and everyone else deserves better.\n\nEasier said than done, sure, but there are no improvements without intention and action. Orgs must be dedicated to P&R coverage, and they must be receptive to potential improvements and course corrections. It requires management to be aware that \"performance\" does not imply \"efficiency\" and vice-versa. Quite simply, gaining any benefits from sufficient test coverage requires that management embrace improvements to \"testing culture\" within their org, and to ensure that sufficient time/cycles/bandwidth on each engineering team's schedule is inclusive of engagement with org-wide performance engineering directives.\n\n[1] LinkedIN image reference: [www.linkedin.com/feed/upda...](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229901279039291394)\n\n",
