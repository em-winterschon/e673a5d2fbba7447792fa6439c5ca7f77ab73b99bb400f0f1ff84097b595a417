			 <p>Ever wondered how The World Bank&rsquo;s open source software contributions have shaped global economics, financial markets, and generally been used for all manner of really quite fascinating insights into data science?</p>
<p>How about the ways in which The World Bank&rsquo;s usage of Ai and LLMs have helped scientists understand populations at risk, how to analyze massive datasets to respond to climate catastrophes, and how to accurately predict global infrastructure changes before they occur?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; it&rsquo;s our lucky day!</p>
<p>The World Bank regularly posts Jupyter notebooks, LLM tooling, data-sets, data analytics scripts, global dashboards related to climate sciences, infrastructure, poverty assessment, economic awareness modeling, and so much more&hellip; right over here on their GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/worldbank/repositories">github.com/orgs/worl&hellip;</a></p>
<p>One item recently in the FOSS news was this gem, the Metadata Editor.</p>

<p>This is a heartening example of the beauty and benefits which Open Source Software offer to our world.</p>

			 <p>At airport gate, waiting. Originally, a dawn departure.</p>
<p>Hilton at ORD decides that rooms do not need the usual bathroom items, and prefers the full plastic half-assed attempt at a capsule pod coffee maker. Substantial displeasure occurs, events transpire, and now we&rsquo;re rebooked on flight a few hours later ‚Äî sleeping in for those hours and have been ‚Äì words and thoughts ‚Äì but brain still not really awake. Robin is finding coffees somewhere on the concourse.</p>

			 <p>ETA, 2 hours till movers arrive, in yet another episode of&hellip; &ldquo;Take only what you need to survive&rdquo;, and they&rsquo;re packing up everything else for transit. Countdown to California thereafter.</p>
<p>Goodbye to another location. I suppose that I could say that Chicago was beneficial in the larger sense of existential purposes, and that much was accomplished, sure sure.</p>
<p>However, and not in jest, nearly the entirety of those accomplishments could have occurred in an old military quonset hut located off-grid, deep in the vast stretches of the Northern Nevada desert, preferably near the Ruby Mountains. It&rsquo;s far more beautiful out there, truly yes, but the pizza is not delivered, and Chicago does have very good pizza. ü§ç</p>

			 <p>Memories of Japan are easy to get lost in, the time period was often a blur. Capsule hotels, bullet trains, insomnia, and several neuro-cognitive mods offering symbiotic boosts to perception. An immediate realization dawned upon landing, so many people seem to love tall western women, to be quite vocal in appreciation and awareness, and hey that&rsquo;s me!</p>
<p>Those were memories of a pure, simple existence, the joy of living in a beautiful foreign land with a wonderfully kind culture; one where I could not read a single sign, nor understand more than several helpful conversational phrases. A stranger in a strange land. A summer of intense philosophical reassessment, of isolationist meditation, with the majority of months spent traveling alone through four countries across two hemispheres. Circa 2017 feels so far away.</p>
<p>Perhaps more travel photos will follow. I&rsquo;m in a reflective mood today. ü©∑</p>

			 <p>Sunday offers an EOD and EOW wrap up thoughts, with some meandering grammatical expressionism. Present state of this week&rsquo;s hardware resource aggregation into one of the LLM research boxes is&hellip; 98%. The data migration from earlier today is complete, with ZFS offering some enjoyable numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>zpool scrub cranking out 19.6G/s, with 2.74T scanned at approx 2min, with the pool predicting a total of 38min to complete</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While building the spec and futzing with the BOM, one of my priorities was to ensure zero PCIe lane contention, with I/O going direct to 64 cores at 3.5GHz peaks, and eight memory channels in use (4x ECC-REG + 4x NVDIMM). All of those conditions have been benchmarking well so far; yay for meeting personally set expectations. ü§ó</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say this is mostly pretty decent for a draid1 array with NVMe on a single-socket Xeon ICX box, and so far much better than the dual socket Ice Lake boxes that I was benching at ${OldOrg}. The recurring two-socket issue on this Xeon generation, and on its successor Sapphire Rapids, is that there&rsquo;s too much cross-socket comms unless specific choices are made with PCIe peripherals and specific choices with BIOS tuning and kernel settings and core-pinning; all of which can be time consuming at a minimum, and head scratching with &ldquo;Just call Premier Support!&rdquo; at the far end, unless you know better.</p>
<p>This should not come as a surprise to anyone who has been benchmarking multi-socket Xeons ever since Xeons were brought into existence. Having had that experience, and because <em>&ldquo;data + facts + personal experience == real answers&rdquo;</em>, it was simple to predict performance concerns related to cross-socket latency, and don&rsquo;t forget PCIe slot to socket sequencing and NUMA domain crossing, especially when optimizing for high-throughput network based storage transfers. If you scaled a 1 socket to 2 to 4 on the old Nehalem-EX based Xeons, then you know what I mean - they could never match the classic Big Iron vendors' quad-socket designs like Sun&rsquo;s SPARC T3 and M3 series, and certainly not competitive to IBM&rsquo;s POWER7 options.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s a little game to play in storage server land called, &ldquo;high density rack-scale storage is more efficient with single socket boards, using a high-lane count, high-clock, big cache SKUs&rdquo;. This isn&rsquo;t the time for a lesson in predictive algorithms necessary for resource optimization, ones which should be used when determining cost/benefit analysis of horizontal vs vertical (or combined) storage system scaling at the rack-level; but <strong>it is time</strong> for me to get off of the computer and eat some cherries and watch one of the alternate endings for Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty!</p>
<p>And really, for a Sunday evening, remaining at this standing desk in the office-lab is not appealing, particularly due to the <em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just too damn hot for pants!&quot;</em> environment, even with the A/C on full blast (common metric for this lab, though it&rsquo;s fine weather for a skirt).</p>
<p>PS, the pool scub finished with zero errors. I am pleased. Migration complete.</p>
