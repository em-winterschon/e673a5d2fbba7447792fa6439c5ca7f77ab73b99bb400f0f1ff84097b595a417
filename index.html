			 <p>The vast and varied subject of <em>Women&rsquo;s Safety Online</em> is a topic which impacts many facets of daily life, including emotional and physical well-being. This post is not a primer on the concepts, rather it offers a short timeline to explain why I am no longer on LinkedIn or Twitter social networks for reasons of personal safety and privacy.</p>
<p><strong>A Tenuous Timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Some years prior to a decade ago, I joined LinkedIn, and a small handful of years ago I joined Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Along the way a serious incident occurred, resulting in PTSD from a bodily assault; the details of which require privacy. During associated therapy a HIPAA violation occured, eroding my trust in the medical establishment.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Periodically I would receive messages on LinkedIn from recruiters at the company where that man worked. I did not want to be reminded of the events, and would never work at the same company. These external intrusions into trauma memories were not healthy and they needed to stop.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Concerns evolved which necessitated telling that company to remove me from their recruiting database and never message me ever again.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> The company removed my profile, and they asked if I wanted to be involved with an investigation, which I refused for the unfortunately common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not want to relive events, especially after the HIPAA issue</li>
<li>I did not want to discuss those memories with yet another stranger</li>
<li>I did not want to become more of a target for speaking up</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible catch-22, and yet it&rsquo;s nothing new. This person needed to be prevented from ever contacting me or knowing anything about my life, requirements which the company could not ensure.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> For safety reasons, I changed my legal name, then I moved, and started a new job. Then I enabled a service which monitors for identity theft issues and personal-info data leaks. Other precautions were made. The whole process is time consuming, emotionally disruptive, and fiscally burdensome.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Years pass. In the interim, LinkedIn&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;people you might know!&quot;</em> feature will routinely recommend that I connect with people who reminded me of that trauma.</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature cannot be disabled and profile settings do not help. Blocking people and profiles does not sufficiently help. Their algorithm always does this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8)</strong> Years pass. Identity theft issues become a greater risk. Someone on Twitter steals my profile, impersonating me to sell web3 tokens or whatever. I report it, and Twitter demands my government ID - which I refuse to upload.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferring a human interaction, I offer to bring my ID to the Twitter office and show it to someone in person, but no - they want the digital copy to keep on file, which will totally never be leaked in a data breach.</li>
<li>I refuse to upload the document. They lock my account. I have not bothered since.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9)</strong> Years pass. A few weeks ago, I&rsquo;m running a social media account audit and notice that LinkedIn has two unknown logins from another country - and I&rsquo;ve never been there, nor connected to an ISP or VPN or service related to that location.</p>
<ul>
<li>I revoke the logins, yet they reappear a week later.</li>
<li>My account has 2FA enabled, yet the auth logs do not show it being used.</li>
<li>Who is behind these logins? What amount of personal info and connections and messages do they have access to?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10)</strong> After seeking help from LinkedIn&rsquo;s support system, they now want my government ID, just like Twitter.</p>
<ul>
<li>They want a third party service (Persona) to scan it, and surely this will never be leaked (sure sure).</li>
<li>They assure that this third party is very safe, that they only give LinkedIn redacted info (yet Persona keeps the full info?)</li>
<li>Surely I should trust their entire system. I do not trust their system, and I will not upload my ID for it to be stolen or have any of the data used in some way to harm me.</li>
<li>The result is similar to Twitter, my account is restricted with no access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End Results and Oh Well&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>So, goodbye LinkedIn, goodbye Twitter.</p>
<p>I cannot place my trust in these faceless social media corporations, the ones which never assume responsibility for data leaks, data theft, or the sale of demographics and usage meta-data. The common refrain of, <em>&ldquo;we&rsquo;re telling you that we redacted your personal information&rdquo;</em>, means nothing substantial from these organizations.</p>
<p>These sites profit extensively from user data - we are their product for sale, and when that happens it can lead to extremely unsafe conditions, particularly if that data can be used for location tracking, enabling access which leads to physical violence, stalking, harassment, or other detriments by which women too-often experience the online world.</p>
<p>Sure, I could upload my ID and <em>&ldquo;just trust them&rdquo;</em>, but that would not make me safer; it would invalidate the entire purpose of protecting my body, my mind, my future. Handing them my trust, when they have routinely proven that they are not trustworthy, would render-pointless every hardship and effort towards safety and security which I&rsquo;ve been required to endure since those events so many years ago.</p>
<p>By prioritizing my personal safety in both of these cases, the end result is that I am no longer able to engage and connect with people from my work life via the two most common business-centric social networks. The alternative is no alternative at all; <strong>choosing not to be safe is not a choice</strong>.</p>
<p>I know what it&rsquo;s like to have my choice taken from me, and I never want that to happen again.</p>

		<a href="https://prose.winterschon.com/2025/05/23/oh-look-fedora-crashed-again.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-05-28 17:27:48 -0500">May 28, 2025</time></a>

			 <p>The Q4-2024 through Q2-2025 cycle has been one of remarkable instability for Fedora kernels and systemd breaking-changes. F40 through F42 have offered more crashes, more kernel panics, and more core dumps than any triple-set of versions since its dawning into existence - and I&rsquo;ve been running this distro for dev-only boxes since the first release.</p>
<p>In the worst of circumstances, Fedora notified me of a firmware update, which was a hands-off type of &ldquo;reboot to install&rdquo; EFI blob which bricked my Thinkpad X1 Nano laptop just last week. That&rsquo;s an expensive failure and one which has no simple resolution (many hours, many iso to img to efi/cap conversions, and maybe soon a WSOP-8 NAND reprogramming).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been all-in on the RedHat infra train since 1999, having used it at global backbone providers, satellite infra providers, hpc clusters, media conglomerates, gaming networks, streaming services, cloud providers and hyperscalers, and just about everything in-between&hellip; and while I have my qualms on certain technical aspects and corporate strategy over those years, I still consider it one of my favorite Linux distos (top five at least), and it&rsquo;s my first choice for enterprise Linux. So, I&rsquo;m not just hating on the ecosystem here, I&rsquo;m a vested user who&rsquo;s been disappointed too many times by the direction</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with Fedora, I stand behind my position that Redhat has been too hands-off in conducting standards requirement alignment, in requiring a base level of stability upon which serious engineering development can be done, without having to clean up other people&rsquo;s messes every few weeks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a great dev platform distro anymore, and yet the org markets the name as if it were a valid OS for all manner of production uses. IoT use? Never, no thanks. Edge devices? Never again. Security? Forget about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;bleeding-edge issue&rdquo; - as that&rsquo;s Rawhide&rsquo;s territory where stability of any sort is not expected. The evolving issue with Fedora is that it is uncommonly unstable for a &ldquo;dev env&rdquo;, and one which ships far too much untested code and pushes the equivalent of &ldquo;crowd source fail-tests&rdquo; where they expect the users to &ldquo;just tell us if it doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;. Their release engineering and load-testing seems to occur with zero multivariate matrices sequences for all manner of performance, validation, and functional tests. I suppose they consider unit testing to be &ldquo;full coverage&rdquo;, but it is not. Happy to be corrected here, though I will remain disappointed and avoid any further deployments or firmware updates from Fedora.</p>

			 <p>While using Soundcloud the other day, prompted by a little helper fellow which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Import your Spotify Playlists!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ok, sure. I&rsquo;d like to use a single app for music if possible, and I prefer Soundcloud to Spotify in general. So, I click ok and authorize the apps' APIs to do their thing.</p>
<p>It finishes importing. Great, back to work. Life goes on. Days later, that being five minutes ago, sitting at my desk&hellip; <em>&ldquo;time for some metal&rdquo;</em> and decide to play a near-daily favorite, <em>&ldquo;Heaven Shall Burn&rdquo;</em> compilation playlist which consists only of their music.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Soundcloud decided to import and use for the Heaven Shall Burn playlist (attached image). Look at the artist names, the album covers, the lack of sequential existence of tracks which should all be on the same several-albums. These aren&rsquo;t even the same category of music, let alone the same band or albumns.</p>
<p><strong>Soundcloud, you have failed.</strong> This was an easy one; you have the API calls with the correct track and author IDs right there in the Spotify playlists to do the import calls on a 1:1 basis, but no, instead you&rsquo;ve taken a giant pile of garbage and put it on my Library.</p>
<p>Instead of <em><strong>&ldquo;Protector&rdquo; by Heaven Shall Burn</strong></em>, you give me <em>&quot;<strong>Protector&quot; by Beyonce</strong></em>. Trust me, they are not equivalent. This is garbage, more enshittification of the internet by unchecked unvalidated coding styles which prioritize <em>&ldquo;we ship code always&rdquo;</em> over <em>&ldquo;we ship when code is ready</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m left with extra work to do, to clean up their mess of shitty playlists, and the tool imported A LOT of playlists.</p>

			 <p>While training for The Death Ride one year, so many years ago, I had quite a surprise on Highway 88 while descending Carson Pass in the Sierra Nevada. This was in the late season, the last week of October, a last minute plan with a best friend to get one last ride in before the snow storms arrived. On top of the usual physical challenges of climbing ~2,500' vertical up to 8,575 elevation, it was uncommonly cold.</p>
<p>For the background, I loved endurance racing, and the many long, standing (not seated) hill climbs and mountain passes always were my favorite. Climbing the front-side and then heading down the back-sides of big mountain passes in the Sierra Nevada at 50+mph (80kph) was however not my favorite - but a good lesson in reaping what you sow. Thankfully I never crashed on those, despite having climbed all of the majors and several lesser traveled, many times over: Monitor, Ebbetts, Carson, Echo, Rose, Yuba, Donner, Tioga, Brockway, Daggett, Luther, Pacific Grade Summit, and famously adjacent Geiger Grade going to Virginia City (a common morning ride before work). All of my crashes were on mountain and cyclo-cross, so I was certainly not immune.</p>
<p>The closest I came to a high speed get-off was on Carson Pass (highway 88), back in 2001. I was riding a new set of criterium race wheels that were ultra-lightweight, perfect for climbing up the pass to the summit, but during the descent speed-wobbles had set-in around the 45mph point and continued through to 54mph, starting directly after the first major right-hand curve.</p>
<p>While arc&rsquo;ing the bike inside the turn, standard approach to manage centrifugal force, and then leaning it back upright as the road straightened, harmonic distortion set in, rippling faster and faster through the bike&rsquo;s frame, up into my body, blurring my vision. Sometimes going faster will sort out the wave, but not this time, and by 50mph the flexing nearly tore the wheels apart from a combination of light-weight hubs and spokes/rims not having sufficient torsional strength to sustain the pressure involved with the induced coefficient-of-friction and centrifugal force.</p>
<p>This was the kind of turn with speed, which one can see racers engage with on the Tour, which require a rear-side body-torque movement to snap/push the frame out of its desire to continue through the curve and resume going straight - too much downward force started to turn the wheel into an slight oval. This same body movement is used in MotoGP and motocross racing, as it&rsquo;s an essential skill for powering through a curve while pushing physical limits. The feeling was like that of an al-dente noodle, if one were to imagine being thrown down a hill while trying to keep everything straight and rigid - just stiff enough to not immediately die, but very close to dying really quickly. Wearing a helmet in that case wouldn&rsquo;t have saved my life, as the pass is surrounded by granite walls and boulders and steep drops.</p>
<p>It took an entire mile of deceleration, achieved through pulsing the front and rear brakes at a 30/70% ratio (like anti-lock brakes on a car, but without the computer), to safely slow down enough for the distortion to resolve. If you don&rsquo;t pulse the brakes then the pads can overheat and melt, contributing far worse conditions into the mix. By the ~30mph point I had recovered enough control over the bike to gently guide us to a turnout several miles down the pass and then dismount. A lot of adrenaline that day, the intensity of focus and attention to the senses required was certainly a high-point at my youngish age (early 20s).</p>
<p>My friend, a far better racer than I&rsquo;d ever become, could only laugh at the scene. It wasn&rsquo;t either of our first experiences with harmonic distortion, and what else is there to do but laugh and get back on the bike? Away we went, continuing down the steep but fast and straight-smooth road to Woodfords where we parked the car.</p>
<p>Well anyway, I had those wheels relaced with bladed titanium spokes and hardened steel nipples tensioned with a digital torque meter (not &ldquo;feeling the torque by hand&rdquo;), and never used them for hill climbs ever again.</p>
<p>As for The Death Ride, they no longer include Highway 88&rsquo;s Carson Pass on the route, mostly due to safety.</p>
